When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    -When I want to make it public for others to view and possibly add to.

    Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

        -The remote repository might have a partial commit that might now work completely by it's own, and if your local repository keeps changing automatically, that might cause you some confusion when you are working on your own local changes.
